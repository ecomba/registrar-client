h1. Registrar Client

This library provides a common API for communicating with multiple registrars. This is necessary since different registrars support different TLDs and different add-on services.

h2. Usage

To construct a client, first require both the generic API interface as well as a specific provider. Construct the provider and pass it to the client interface:

  require 'registrar'
  require 'registrar/provider/enom'

  provider = Registrar::Provider::Enom.new
  client = Registrar::Client.new(provider)

To split a domain into its TLD and its remaining part:

  name = 'example.com'
  client.parse(name)
  => ['example','com']

To check the availability of a domain name for registration:

  client.available?(name)
  => true
